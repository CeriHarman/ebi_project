# ebi_project
Files to merge indelible and pyvolve functions to provided simulated data with different omegas and indels based on custom matrices.

#some files on here for reference:
- project.py, first file made, indelible and pyvolve simulations
- site.py, second file made, indelible, pyvolve, sites extracted from indelible dna_RATES
- sites_added.py, third file made, indelible, pyvolve, and sites then added to pyvolve simulations

- working on merging the three pyvolve simulations
- reflecting the indel patterns from indelible onto this merged fasta
